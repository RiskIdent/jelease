# Jira settings
jira:
  # Sets the Jira URL. If you host Jira under a different base path (e.g /jira)
  # then you need to include that in the URL, like so:
  #   url: https://issues.apache.org/jira/
  #
  # If when browsing the Jira your URL says:
  #   https://jira.example.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa
  # then you should set the URL to:
  #   url: https://jira.example.com
  #
  # However, if it says:
  #   https://jira.example.com/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa
  # then you should set the URL to:
  #   url: https://jira.example.com/jira
  url: https://jira.example.com
